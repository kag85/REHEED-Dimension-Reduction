If using windows, this guide will help use ffmpeg to convert a .avi file to frames at a specified fps.  
First install ffmpeg.  There are a variety of guides to do so.
You may then go into the command prompt, go to the folder where you would like to place the frames.  
Make sure that the video of interest is the only thing in this folder, then enter:

ffmpeg -i MovieName.avi -vf  fps = 4  c01_%04d.jpg -hide_banner
