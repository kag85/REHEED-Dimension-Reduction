Repository to assist in using dimension reduction methods on RHEED videos.
The "ffmpeg usage" file will demonstrate the line of code I used to convert .avi files to frames at the desired frames per second (fps).
The Jupyter Notebook file is the code used on those frames to perform principal component analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, and kmeans clustering. 
The pdf file is an example of the code used on my work.
